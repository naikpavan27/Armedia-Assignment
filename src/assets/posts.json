      "fullDescription": "Special relativity was promptly confirmed by different experiments, although it was in stark contrast to Newton's theory, in which the gravitational interaction propagates at unlimited speed (and not at the speed of light). Einstein took these two problems (which were considered marginal at the time) very seriously, and it took him ten years of hard study to complete his masterpiece: the general relativity.which found that a feature of objects (what we now call) governs their resistance to changing their state of motion or rest.which found that a feature of objects (what we now call) governs their resistance to changing their state of motion or rest.",

      "fullDescription": "General relativity, like many of Einstein's works, is founded on some principles, mainly theoretical axioms based on empirical findings. To overcome Galileo's concept of inertial system, Einstein proposed that all physical laws must be the same regardless of observer motion (i.e. for any reference system). Furthermore, based on Galileo's observations, he developed the , which states that inertial mass and gravitational mass are not very similar, but are the same physical quantity.which found that a feature of objects (what we now call) governs their resistance to changing their state of motion or rest.",
